# rock-paper-scissors

In this project, I am going to create a program that lets a user play with computer, a basic game regarding rock vs paper vs scissors. It gets the input of the user and the user have to choose from the three choices; rock, paper, or scissors. Then the computer will choose a random choice as well. There winner will be decided based on the choices made. 
Rules will be:
-Rock beats Scissors
-Scissors beats Paper
-Paper beats Rock

This game will initially be played on the console as per the instructions in the odin project, but as the lessons progress, I will add more functionalities in the future. 



// Create a function called getComputerChoice that will randomly return either `Rock`, `Paper`, or `Scissors`
// Create a function that gets the player choice, call it playerSelection

// Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take 2 parameters, playerSelection and computerSelection and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like: `You Lose! Paper beats Rock!` **Make your  function's playerSelection parameter case-sensitive(so users can input rock, ROCK, Rock or any other variations)
