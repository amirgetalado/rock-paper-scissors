# rock-paper-scissors

In this project, I am going to create a program that lets a user play with computer, a basic game regarding rock vs paper vs scissors. It gets the input of the user and the user have to choose from the three choices; rock, paper, or scissors. Then the computer will choose a random choice as well. There winner will be decided based on the choices made. 
Rules will be:
-Rock beats Scissors
-Scissors beats Paper
-Paper beats Rock

This game will initially be played on the console as per the instructions in the odin project, but as the lessons progress, I will add more functionalities in the future.
